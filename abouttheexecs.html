        <p> Hello! I am currently in my senior year at Abbey Park and one of the co-creators of Musical Performance Club at Abbey Park. I've been playing the guitar for 6 years and I really enjoy playing covers of my favourite songs! Other hobbies I have are gaming, watching shows and doing little projects (like coding this website!). I wanted to create this club to host events for students who have a passion for music and performing!</p>

        <p> Hi! I am a grade 12 student at Abbey Park and one of the co-creators of Musical Performance Club! I like music and playing my favourite songs on the guitar makes me really relaxed. In my free time I like to sleep, go to the gym, and hangout with close friends. I wanted to make this club with my friend to share a music engaged community for Abbey Park students. I also like hosting events and being involved with the school.</p>
