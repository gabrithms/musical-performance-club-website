        <p> APHS Musical Performance Club's Battle of the Bands was a huge success! The event brought together talented students across Abbey Park for an evening of fun and incredible performances! The event was split between solo acts and bands, with each performer showcasing their style, leaving the audience cheering and voting for their winners. It was truly an unforgettable night, and we cannot wait to see what the 2025 participants will bring! </p>

        <p> Held in the foyer of Abbey Park, the End of the Year Performance allowed for members to have one last performance before summer break. Students performed at the end of the day, and it was an afternoon of remembering the good times we had during meetings as well as all the memories and friends we made.</p>
